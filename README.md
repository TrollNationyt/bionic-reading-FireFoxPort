# bionic-reading-FireFoxPort
A FireFox port for bionic-reading extension!

This extension was made by me on May 20th in about 15 minutes of coding time. Please forgive any bugs as it hasn't been widely tested. Feel free to report them in Github Issues. Also, feel free to open a PR to fix any issues. I will review them quickly.

If there is interest, I am happy to work on this more and make it a dedicated screen reader.

## What is Bionic Reading?
Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artficial fixation points.
As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word.
In a digital world dominated by shallow forms of reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written content.
